Backend mini-project: Public Utility Bill Payment and Invoice Generation System

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem Statement:
Mangalore’s citizens often face challenges with timely utility bill payments due to inefficient
systems. Design a utility bill payment system that processes payment requests and
generates invoices for electricity, water, and gas bills, while handling urgent requests like
disconnections or overdue payments with priority.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Requirements:
● Use a queue to handle bill payment requests, ensuring they are processed in the
order they are received.
● Implement a priority queue for urgent situations, such as overdue bills, disconnection
notices, or reconnection requests.
● Use Stacks to track historical transactions, enabling users to view or undo their
previous bill payments if any errors occur.
● Store transaction records using file handling, generating invoices for each payment
and storing them in .pdf or .csv format.
● Log daily transactions and overdue payments in a .json or .csv file for monthly
auditing by utility companies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Procedure:
Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement
● Review the problem you selected and fully understand the requirements. Break down
the problem into smaller components (API design, data management, etc.).
Step 2: Set Up the Node.js Environment
● Initialise a Node.js project. Install necessary packages like Express (for APIs), fs for
file handling, and any other required modules.
Step 3: Design the API
● Design the API endpoints (e.g., POST for creating data, GET for retrieving data).
Ensure that your API allows users to report issues, fetch information, and process
real-time updates.
Step 4: Implement Stacks and Queues
● Use Queues to manage incoming requests (e.g., reports, data processing).
Implement Stacks to store historical data and enable backtracking or undo
functionality where necessary.
Step 5: Integrate Asynchronous Programming
● Implement async functions to handle real-time data (e.g., fetching updates, sending
notifications). Use async techniques like async/await and Promise.all() to
manage multiple requests and real-time operations.
Step 6: Use File Handling for Data Persistence
● Log important data (e.g., user reports, status updates) into .json or .csv files using
Node’s file handling capabilities. Ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data using
file streams where necessary.

Outcome:
By the end of this activity, you will have built a backend solution that addresses a real-world
problem using Node.js. You will learn how to design APIs, efficiently manage tasks with
Stacks and Queues, handle asynchronous operations, and store/retrieve data using file
handling techniques. You’ll also gain experience in managing real-time updates and
optimising system performance.
